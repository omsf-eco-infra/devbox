## AWS Account Setup

This is a once-per-account process. Individual users will not need to do this.

Create `main.tf` with contents similar to the following:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

## Individual User Setup

Each user will have to complete these steps once, but this will be reused
between different DevBox projects.

1. Set up your SSH keys.
   - Generate a new SSH key pair if you don't have one.
   - Add the public key to your AWS account's EC2 key pairs.


## DevBox Setup

This is for an individual DevBox project. 

## Troubleshooting

### connect to host `<ip>` port 22: Connection refused

Sometimes you'll get this error if you try to SSH into a DevBox immediately
after it start running. This is because sometimes the networking is not fully
set up yet. Wait a few seconds and try again.
